# codealpha_tasks
A machine learning project to predict sales based on advertising spend.
                        📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Sales using Machine Learning techniques.
The dataset contains advertising investments across different media platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper, and the goal is to analyze how these factors affect sales.

The project also helps in understanding:

:How advertising spend influences sales

:How to clean and prepare data

:How to build and evaluate a regression model

                📂 Dataset Used

    Columns in the dataset:
Column Name     |  	Description

TV	            |   Advertising spend on TV
